# 🦠💻📈 <span style="color:blue">Predicting COVID-19 Patient Outcomes: A Data Science Project</span>
## 👋 <span style="color:green">Introduction</span>
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill, and healthcare providers have struggled to manage resources effectively. One of the major challenges has been predicting the resource requirements of individual patients. In this project, I have analyzed the COVID-19 patient pre-condition dataset to predict patient outcomes and provide insights that can aid healthcare providers in making more informed decisions.

## 🚀 <span style="color:green">Pipeline</span>
### 🎯 <span style="color:purple">Objective</span>
The goal of this project is to predict whether a COVID-19 patient is likely to survive or not and provide insights that can help healthcare providers manage resources more efficiently.

### 🧹 <span style="color:purple">Data Wrangling</span>
The dataset contained missing values and mislabeled data, which had to be dealt with before analysis. Once the data was cleaned, it was ready for exploration.

### 🔍 <span style="color:purple">Exploratory Data Analysis</span>
The EDA process revealed some interesting insights. For instance, the majority of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were males, while females were more likely to test negative. Additionally, a large percentage of patients who had pneumonia and smoked were male.

### 🤖 <span style="color:purple">Modeling</span>
After conducting EDA, I built a model to predict patient outcomes. The model was trained using a range of classification algorithms, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and evaluated using cross-validation. The best model achieved an accuracy of 83%, which is a promising result.

### 👩‍⚕️💪 <span style="color:green">Conclusion</span>
The insights and predictions generated by this project can aid healthcare providers in making more informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation. By accurately predicting patient outcomes, healthcare providers can ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively, helping to save lives during this pandemic and in the future.
