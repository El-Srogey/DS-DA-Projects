# 🚘💻📈 <span style="color:blue">Reducing High-Fatality Accidents in the UK: A Data Science Project</span>
## 👋 <span style="color:green">Introduction</span>
Road accidents in the UK have been a major concern for public safety, with a significant number of high-fatality accidents occurring each year. In this data science project, we aim to analyze data on road accidents in the UK and develop insights and predictive models to help reduce the number of high-fatality accidents.

## 🚀 <span style="color:green">Pipeline</span>
### 🎯 <span style="color:purple">Objective</span>
The objective of this project is to identify factors that contribute to high-fatality accidents in the UK and develop predictive models to help reduce their occurrence.

### 🧹 <span style="color:purple">Data Wrangling</span>
The data on road accidents in the UK required significant cleaning and processing before it was ready for analysis. This included handling missing and mislabeled data, as well as merging data from multiple sources.

### 🔍 <span style="color:purple">Exploratory Data Analysis</span>
EDA provided insights into factors that contribute to high-fatality accidents in the UK. For instance, we observed that most accidents occurred on single carriageways, in urban areas, and during daylight hours. Additionally, we found that accidents were more likely to occur on roads with higher speed limits.

💡 <span style="color:green">Conclusion</span>
The insights and predictive models generated by this project can aid policymakers and road safety experts in making more informed decisions about road safety measures and resource allocation. By accurately identifying factors that contribute to high-fatality accidents, we can take proactive steps to reduce their occurrence and make UK roads safer for everyone.
