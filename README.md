📖 __Background: You work for the human capital department of a large corporation. The Board is worried about the relatively high turnover, and your team must look into ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company.__

__💪 Competition challenge. Create a report that covers the following:__
1. Which department has the highest employee turnover? Which one has the lowest?
2. Investigate which variables seem to be better predictors of employee departure.
3. What recommendations would you make regarding ways to reduce employee turnover?
